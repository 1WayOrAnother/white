An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Fetishist gets out the hassock,
Turns down the lamp, and bolts the door;
Then in galoshes and a cassock.
He worships it upon the floor.

The Magnate waits upon the pavement
For his enormous limousine,
And ponders further child-enslavement
And other projects still more mean.

The Ressurectionist goes plying
Without ado his simple trade;
Material is always dying
And got with nothing but a spade.
