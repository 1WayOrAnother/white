# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Fetishist gets out the hassock,
Turns down the lamp, and bolts the door;
Then in galoshes and a cassock.
He worships it upon the floor.

The Magnate waits upon the pavement
For his enormous limousine,
And ponders further child-enslavement
And other projects still more mean.

The Ressurectionist goes plying
Without ado his simple trade;
Material is always dying
And got with nothing but a spade.

The Xenophobe grabs at the table,
He feels his toes and fingers curl;
For he is only barely able
To keep from striking down the girl.

The Yegg on rubber soles comes creeping
Inside the house when it is late,
And while the occupants are sleeping,
Removes the heirlooms and the plate.
