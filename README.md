# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Effigy, got up with clothing
Abstracted from the victimâ€™s room,
Is raised aloft to cheers of loathing
Before it meets a flaming doom.

The Hermit lives among the boulders,
He wears no garment but a sack;
By slow degrees his reason boulders,
The sun has long since burnt him black.
