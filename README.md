An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Governess up in the attic
Attempts to make a cup of tea;
Her mind grows daily more erratic
From cold and hunger and ennui.

The Keeper, when itâ€™s time for luncheon,
Flings down his charge upon the bed,
And taking out a home-made truncheon,
Belabors him about the head.ls

The Xenophobe grabs at the table,
He feels his toes and fingers curl;
For he is only barely able
To keep from striking down the girl.

The Yegg on rubber soles comes creeping
Inside the house when it is late,
And while the occupants are sleeping,
Removes the heirlooms and the plate.
